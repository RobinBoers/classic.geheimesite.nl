        This page details what I&#8217;m up to at the moment.<br />

        I&#8217;m at the end of 5VWO now. I&#8217;m getting kinda nervous for my
        exams next year. And Oh. My. God. I&#8217;m almost 18 years old.
        That&#8217;s a big scary number with a lot of attached responsibilities.
        Also yesterday some kid called me &#8220;mister&#8221;. LIKE WHAT??
      </p>

      <p>
        I&#8217;m trying very hard to improve my German grade because currently
        it&#8217;s a 7 (out of 10) and I&#8217;d like it to be an 8, because
        then there&#8217;s a non-zero chance that I&#8217;ll finish VWO with
        honors (cum laude in Dutch).
      </p>

      <p>
        I&#8217;ve replaced my phone with a Casio watch, Discman, paper
        notebook, and Nokia flip phone. I&#8217;m very pleased. It&#8217;s like
        the Unix philosophy IRL. All my tools do <em>one</em> thing, and they do
        it <em>very well</em>. And I only need to charge them once every one to
        two weeks. Also, my every step is no longer tracked by Google. And
        I&#8217;m not distracted all the time. Overall, brilliant idea!
      </p>

      <p>
        I think I might be a Swiftie. Like not a hardcore fan, but I do really
        like her music. I&#8217;m not that well versed in all the easter eggs
        and decades of lore tho. Tho I do have four of her albums as CDs
        (<cite>1989</cite>, <cite>Red</cite>, <cite>reputation</cite>, and
        <cite>TTPD</cite>), and I&#8217;m intending to get four more
        (<cite>Lover</cite>, <cite>Fearless</cite>, <cite>Speak Now</cite>,
        <cite>Midnights</cite>).
      </p>

      <p>
        I&#8217;m working on a prototype
        <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/pull/5859"
          >for merging two-factor authentication into
          <code>phx.gen.auth</code></a
        >. I&#8217;m also building
        <a href="/v/19/blog/challenge-accepted">an experimantal website engine</a>
        that blends multiple layers of the Web.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&#8217;m also thinking more about
        <a href="/v/19/blog/0x10c">interactive end-user programming</a>.
        <del
          >Would make a cool subject for my
          <abbr title="profielwerkstuk">PWS</abbr>&#8230;</del
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Actually, I&#8217;m gonna do my PWS for English. It&#8217;s really
        cool!! We&#8217;re going to design an artificial (constructed) languages
        from scratch. Let&#8217;s see how this goes!
      </p>

      <p>
        I&#8217;ve shelved
        <a href="/v/19//git.dupunkto.org/grape-lang"
          >The Grape Programming Language</a
        >
        and <a href="/v/19//git.dupunkto.org/somtomorrow">Somtomorrow</a>, but do
        intend to finish them sometime the upcoming years.
