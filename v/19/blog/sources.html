        <h1>In favor of the small</h1>

        <p>
          Since the internet went mainstream in the 90s, information has been
          readily available for everyone. But can it be trusted? What makes a
          reliable source? At school, we seem to get taught &#8216;the bigger
          the better&#8217;. Big news sites are generally considered
          trustworthy, while small and relatively unknown sites, like personal
          blogs or forums, are off-limits. However, in my experience, small,
          specialized blogs are typically better sources than those big news
          outlets.
        </p>

        <p>
          For one, random people online usually aren&#8217;t writing to please
          an advertiser, publisher or particular audience&#8212;they&#8217;re
          writing because they&#8217;re passionate about the subject. This makes
          a huge difference, as there is no financial incentive, no money at
          stake, no undisclosed incentives, no monetary gain. They don&#8217;t
          need to clickbait their writing; there&#8217;s no reason to maximize
          views. A blogger that isn&#8217;t financially dependent on their blog
          has no goal to track you or sell ads. They don&#8217;t
          <em>need anything</em> from their readers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, articles on credible news sites are generally written by
          journalists, which is good. They fact-check and remain objective and
          neutral. But, a journalist will always be a generalist: they know a
          little about a lot. Bloggers, on the other hand, can be specialists
          and will often have a more in-depth understanding of the topic at
          hand. In other words: specialized blogs are usually more accurate than
          media coverage on the same subject. You&#8217;re probably
          <a href="/v/19//rubenerd.com/erwin-knolls-law-of-media-accuracy/"
            >familiar with this too, if you&#8217;ve ever read some news item
            about your own profession</a
          >:
        </p>

        <blockquote
          cite="https://rubenerd.com/erwin-knolls-law-of-media-accuracy/">
          <p>
            I&#8217;ve mentioned a few times how easy it is to pick apart
            inaccuracies in media coverage on a topic you know about, and the
            unease that sets in when you realise every topic likely has the same
            issues.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Moreover, bloggers don&#8217;t have any restrictions on their writing:
          they can make their articles as long, technical, and detailed as they
          please, not having to tailor them to a specific audience. Whereas a
          journalist has to make their writing accessible to a larger audience,
          exchanging valuable detail for readability.
        </p>

        <p>
          On blogs and forums, I know that what I&#8217;m reading is the
          authentic and personal experience of an actual person &#8212; not some
          corporate marketing bullshit. I&#8217;m not alone in this btw;
          there&#8217;s a reason people
          <a href="/v/19//dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying"
            >keep appending &#8220;reddit&#8221; to the end of their searches</a
          >. Small blogs are written by <em>people</em>. I think that scares
          institutions like schools, which were created in a world where only
          other big institutions, like media companies and publishers, had the
          ability to put stuff into the world. &#8220;Oh no, actual people are
          now able to write and publish stuff on their own!&#8221; PANIC!
        </p>

        <p>
          The advent of the internet caused a huge shift in the way we find and
          consume information. And we love change&#8212;if we&#8217;re the one
          doing it. But for the rest of us, change is a threat. A threat to what
          is familiar. Familiar is nice. Familiar is comfortable. But that
          doesn&#8217;t mean familiar is good. Yet our education system keeps
          desperately clinging onto what it finds familiar.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what if we instead embrace the internet and the voices it gives to
          ordinary people? Maybe a more diverse and less formalised set of
          sources will actually be an enrichment for class. Offer us new
          perspectives we hadn&#8217;t thought of before.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, I think we should be more kind towards stuff written by people.
          It&#8217;s not scary; it&#8217;s just different.

            blogs, but rather the things you&#8217;d find on the
