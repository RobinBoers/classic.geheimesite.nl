        <h1>love, hate</h1>

        <p>
          This lyric from Olivia O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s song
          <cite>hate u love u</cite> summarizes my relationship with the Web
          almost perfectly:
        </p>

        <blockquote
          cite="https://open.spotify.com/track/6ATgDc6e4sPn84hvJsAmPt"
        >
          <p>
            I hate you, I love you<br />
            I hate that I love you
          </p>
          <p>
            Don&#8217;t want to, but I can&#8217;t put<br />
            nobody else above you
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Cause, as a developer, I lóve the Web. The web browser is a blank
          canvas that can be used to build virtually anything. HTML, CSS,
          Javascript&#8212;the languages used to build websites&#8212;are easy
          to grasp but at the same time extremely powerful and versatile. There
          are APIs for literally anything I&#8217;d want to build. And unlike
          low-level languages such as C and Rust, a website doesn&#8217;t make
          me to deal with a complicated toolchain; I don&#8217;t need to think
          about complex cross-compilation, memory allocation, dynamic linkers or
          glibc. I simply upload my HTML files to my server using
          <code>rsync</code>, and it automagically Just Works™.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, as a consumer, I absolutely detest the Web. It feels like
          it&#8217;s turned from a wild, collaborative, global creative space
          into something akin to a shopping mall. It&#8217;s just
          <a href="//how-i-experience-web-today.com">straight up depressing</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone&#8217;s talking about <em>monetization</em>,
          <em>growth hacking</em>, <em>ad-revenue</em>. Everywhere I go,
          I&#8217;m met with pages full of plausible sounding AI-generated
          SEO-optimized nonsense. I get asked to accept these
          <em>delicious</em> cookies, to sign up for the newsletter, and to
          create a (<em>free!!</em>) account. Also:
          <em>this content is better in the app</em>! And we&#8217;re
          <em
            >announcing our next-gen AI-powered blockchain startup, check it
            out!</em
          >
          All while some completely unrelated video starts autoplaying in the
          background. And that&#8217;s without even talking about the ads.
        </p>

        <p>
          These websites are not built for you <em>to read</em>, they are
          designed for <em>extracting value from your visit</em>. Desperately
          trying to squeeze every last drop of data out of you, before you
          inevitably close the tab.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Note about monetization</summary>
          <p>
            It&#8217;s not that I think creative people shouldn&#8217;t be
            fairly compensated. Of course they should. But this isn&#8217;t
            about them. This is about a cultural shift that turns the Web into a
            business platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you make something&#8212;art, music, film&#8212;and put it online
            for others to see, but also request to be compensated for your work,
            that&#8217;s totally fair. But what we&#8217;re seeing now is
            companies hijacking the Web, replacing genuine people writing making
            real things, with SEO-optimized clickbait meant to make money quick.
