        <h1>The Beginning</h1>

        <p>
          The dawn of the universe is a paradox. There are two ways to explain
          it:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The universe has a beginning. Something initiated the universe,
              which raises the question: how did that thing get there? And if
              there was no thing&#8212;the universe sprung from
              nothing&#8212;how can all be made from none?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The universe has no beginning&#8212;it has always existed in some
              form or capacity. This seems contradictory: how can everything
              exist forever? All this <em>stuff</em> must come from somewhere,
              right?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Saying you know the truth of the origin of the universe is lying to
          yourself. Nobody knows &#8212; and nobody will ever know. We simply
          can&#8217;t grasp the very beginning; it&#8217;s too contradictory.
          It&#8217;s all-encompassing&#8212;too immense for a single human being
          to fathom.
        </p>

        <p>
          We must learn to live with the fact that we might never know the truth
          to some things. And I know, that&#8217;s hard. It means letting go of
          the little grip we have on reality. But ultimately, it&#8217;s the
          only real answer we have.
          <em>We don&#8217;t know, and that&#8217;s okay.</em>
        </p>
