        <h1>Rules</h1>

        <p>
          <a href="https://blog.geheimesite.nl/notes/regels/">In the past</a>
          I&#8217;ve written about what I called &#8220;two rules for any
          well-functioning group&#8221;:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Everyone behaves</li>
            <li>Everyone should have fun</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          However, I was probably wrong. Because while small groups of people
          are pretty much self-organizing, as the group grows, some hierarchy is
          needed. In a relatively small group&#8212;everyone knows
          everyone&#8212;rules are generally unneeded, as people tend to behave
          properly due to peer pressure and social dynamics. However, the
          controlling effect of peer pressure breaks down in larger groups,
          because people are relatively anonymous. Social dynamics alone are not
          effective anymore, hence the need for formal rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          So while you can get away with my two rules for a small group,
          let&#8217;s say a classroom of around ~25 people, they will most
          definitely cause complete anarchy and chaos when applied to the entire
          school of around 700 students.
        </p>

        <p>I was right about one thing tho:</p>

        <blockquote>
          If there is no basis for the rule, the rule doesn&#8217;t work, or the
          rule is unneeded, it should probably not be a rule.
