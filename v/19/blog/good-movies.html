        <h1>Movies and Limited Series</h1>

        <p>So lately I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Netflix.</p>

        <p>
          Generally, I&#8217;m not the kind of person that consumes a lot of
          media. I&#8217;d rather make things; I find creating things way more
          satisfying.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, I got a bit burned out in terms of ideas&#8212;I didn&#8217;t
          know what to build&#8212; energy, and time (school am I right ✨). So,
          instead I spent about 20 hours of my life staring at a screen, looking
          at fictional characters living their almost perfect made-up lives.
        </p>

        <p>Anyways, I really enjoyed these in particular:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>After</li>
          <li>Tick, tick… BOOM!</li>
          <li>Heartstopper</li>
          <li>Inventing Anna</li>
          <li>Bohemian Rhapsody</li>
          <li>Love, Rosie</li>
          <li>Friends with Benefits</li>
          <li>Lady Chatterley&#8217;s Lover</li>
          <li>The Girl Nextdoor</li>
          <li>Queen&#8217;s Gambit</li>
          <li>Don&#8217;t Look Up</li>
          <li>Dirty Lines</li>
          <li>The Social Network</li>
          <li>The Playlist</li>
          <li>The Social Dilemma</li>
          <li>Yesterday</li>
          <li>I Used to Be Famous</li>
          <li>We Are the Wave</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I really enjoyed the miniseries in particular; it allows the filmmaker
          to tell a more detailed story, yet it doesn&#8217;t require as much
          time (and commitment) to watch, as opposed to, for example, a
          7-season-long show.
        </p>

        <p>
          A movie feels short when you&#8217;re used to a series. But
          that&#8217;s part of the appeal I think. A movie doesn&#8217;t try to
          suck you in, like a series does. It just tells a story.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Context</summary>
          <p>
            I wrote this a while back (somewhere fall last year), but I forgot
            to publish it. I found the draft yesterday.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, a lot of movies listed above share one common theme:
            they&#8217;re all semi-related to the reproductive system; I&#8217;m
            a teenager, after all ;)
          </p>
