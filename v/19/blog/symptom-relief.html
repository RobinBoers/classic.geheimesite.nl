        <h1>Banning phones is not solving anything</h1>

        <p>
          A few days ago, I posted some of my thoughts regarding the new mobile
          phone ban in high schools in the Netherlands. I want to add a few more
          things:
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the fundamental problem is not the phones themselves. Why are
          phones distracting? Push notifications and FOMO.
          <em>The phones are not the problem, social media is</em>. And because
          we failed to properly regulate social media, phones are getting
          banned.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ban is a prime example of symptom relief. The government is doing
          nothing to actually address the problem; all they&#8217;re doing is
          prohibiting the manifestation. The ban will <em>not</em> help students
          overcome their addiction. Neither is the ban preventing social media
          use and all the problems than come with it; students are simply going
          to use different devices to access their beloved Snapchat selfies.
        </p>
