        <h1>Challenge accepted</h1>

        <p>
          A while back, I read
          <a href="/v/19//gilest.org/indie-easy.html">
            <cite>Let&#8217;s make the indie web easier</cite></a
          >, and it really resonated with me.
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html">
          <p>OK, developers, I have a challenge for you.</p>
          <p>
            I&#8217;ll assume that we&#8217;re all on board with the 2024 indie
            web revival. We all want things to get weird again, right? Yeah.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, I&#8217;ll assume we all agree that owning your own website is
            a good thing, and we all want more people to do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here&#8217;s the thing: we need more tools for it. We need
            simpler tools for it. And we need to make installing and using them
            trivially simple.
          </p>
          <p>We need a whole galaxy of options.</p>
          <p>
            So that next time we say to someone: “You should own your own
            domain, and publish on your own website,” and they answer with
            “How?”, we can give an answer that&#8217;s more than just: “Install
            Wordpress.”
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want the future web we&#8217;re all clamouring for, we need to
            give people more options for self-hosted independence. If we
            seriously, truly want the independent, non-enshittified personal web
            to flourish, we need to make it easier for people to join in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why not build static website generators that people can just unzip,
            upload to the shared hosting they&#8217;ve just paid for, and start
            using via a browser?
          </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;m building a successor to
          <a href="/v/19//micro.geheimesite.nl">neopub</a>, my microblogging
          platform. It&#8217;s still in early development, but things are going
          great so far. It&#8217;s loosely based on the original source code of
          neopub&#8212;which is why its repo is hosted under the neopub
          namespace&#8212;, but has been rewritten from the ground up.
        </p>

        <p>Here&#8217;s the idea:</p>

        <p>
          A single-person microblogging platform written in PHP8, built on open
          standards. It supports
          <a href="/v/19//microformats.org">microformats2</a>,
          <a href="/v/19//w3.org/TR/micropub">micropub</a>,
          <a href="/v/19//w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmention</a>, pingback, various
          feeds, <a href="/v/19//w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> and
          <a href="/v/19//openheart.fyi">OpenHeart</a>, along with
          <a href="/v/19//personal-web.org">@mentions</a>, which I
          <a href="/v/19/blog/mentions">recently implemented on this site</a> as
          well. There&#8217;s going to be a very basic web interface for writing
          posts and uploading images. Additionally, there will also be a
          CLI&#8212;I&#8217;m gonna be using it myself, after all.
        </p>

        <p>
          To circle back to @giles&#8217;s post, I&#8217;m designing this thing
          to ✨ just work ✨, Out Of The Box™. Because
          <a href="/v/19/blog/defaults">defaults matter</a>. People aren&#8217;t
          going to bother figuring out how to setup some obscure plugin to
          enable some weird protocol they&#8217;ve never heard of&#8212;but they
          might just like it when their site automagically federates with
          various social media platforms and pulls in comments from each one.
        </p>

        <p>
          And to reemphasize his point:
          <em>installing this thing should be trivially simple</em>. It should
          be as simple as creating an account on Bluesky. Cause if it&#8217;s
          not, what&#8217;s stopping people from just switching to another
          content silo?
          <small
            >(I&#8217;m using the
            <a href="/v/19/blog/stupid-terminology">c-word</a> on purpose. These
            corporations don&#8217;t care what you post, as long as they can
            make money off of it.)</small
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the platform is written in PHP, it should work on virtually all
          shared hosting, provided they have an up-to-date PHP installation.
          Installing should be as simple as drag and dropping some PHP files
          over FPT. To reduce friction even more, I&#8217;m using JSON files
          instead of an SQL database, as setting up and connecting an SQL
          database is often a mayor roadblock in installing a CMS, for a casual
          person.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;m also thinking about creating some sort of hosted application
          that integrates with a bunch of common registrars, which would guide
          newcomers through getting a domain name, picking a hosting plan and
          uploading said PHP files. Pick a domain name, pick a registrar, pick a
          plan, and have the service handle the rest for you.
        </p>

        <p>Anyhow.</p>

        <p>
          So far, I&#8217;ve implemented Webmention (both sending and
          receiving), micropub (with a media endpoint), pingback (using
          <a href="/v/19//webmention.io">Webmention.io</a> to forward pingbacks as
          webmentions), and RSS, Atom, JSON feeds. However, I&#8217;m still
          trying to figure out how the actual fuck ActivityPub works, and the
          frontend is nowhere near finished.
        </p>
