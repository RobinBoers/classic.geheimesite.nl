        <h1>The role of generative AI in writing</h1>

        <p>
          Since its introduction a little more than a year ago, we&#8217;ve been
          discussing ChatGPT a lot at school. It&#8217;s an interesting topic,
          for sure. How can it be used in school? By students or teachers? Is
          using AI cheating? Will it interfere with the development of writing
          skills or help? Should it be used at all?
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, we seem to have the urge to ban upcoming technologies that
          radically change things. Indeed, I&#8217;ve repeatedly heard people
          call to ban use of generative AI, calling it plagiarism and fraud.
          However, like everything, the matter is more nuanced than seems to be
          the case at first sight. Even if we were to completely ban generative
          AI, enforcing a ban like that will prove harder and harder the further
          models like GPT evolve. Besides, it probably won&#8217;t restrain
          students from using models like them. Therefore, we should think about
          and discuss how we could properly integrate AI models into our
          writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, here are some of the primary takeaways after using
          ChatGPT on-and-off for about a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          ChatGPT is&#8212;mistakenly&#8212;mainly used to
          <em>generate</em> prose. However, the prose it generates is mediocre;
          it&#8217;s dull and repetitive. Moreover,&#8212;even tho OpenAI tries
          to prevent it&#8212;the model hallucinates fairly often. This means
          nothing it generates can be trusted to be factually correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, it is way more powerful as a tool to edit and transform
          language. As Linus wrote a while back:
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://thesephist.com/posts/latent/">
          <p>
            Not &#8220;computers can complete text prompts, now what?&#8221; but
            &#8220;computers can understand language, now what?&#8221;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The AI models are unable to understand what they are writing about.
          They&#8217;re only selecting words that sound plausible given the
          context of their training data and the prompt. But they do know
          grammar, spelling, and essay structure. That&#8217;s where their
          strength lies. Not the ability to generate okay-sounding essays, but
          their ability to understand and transform language. Use it to your
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of prompting &#8220;can you generate an argumentative essay on
          the role of religion in public schools&#8221;, we should prompt things
          like &#8220;can you rewrite this paragraph to be more academic&#8221;
          or &#8220;can you show me alternatives to this sentence&#8221;.
        </p>
        <p>
          ChatGPT and similar models are not a threat to writing. Instead, they
          are merely new tools that can&#8212;if utilized
          correctly&#8212;further improve our writing. The impact they will have
          is purely defined by how we use them.

          <p>Some additional notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              LLMs are best used in combination with existing tools, like
              <a href="//jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">a good dictionary</a>,
              thesaurus, and spell checkers.
            </li>
            <li>
              It&#8217;s really a bit silly to call this category of AI
              &#8220;generative&#8221;, because (in my opinion) that&#8217;s the
              thing they&#8217;re worst at.

                >post I quoted from Linus</a
              >
              is great and you should definitely read it!
