        <h1>The Web is the everything protocol</h1>

        <p>
          I love building websites; I also
          <a href="/v/19/blog/love-hate">hate the Web</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like the concept of the Web: interlinked documents with optional
          embedded media. Just pages of text with images and videos here and
          there. Think books but with interactive elements. The Web was meant to
          be that: a great document reader.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet we&#8217;re increasingly treating it as an SDK of some sort. A
          Universal Application Development ToolKit. Further and further
          emulating native applications using JavaScript APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just look at the ridiculous scope of these Javascript APIs:
          WebBattery, WebBluetooth, WebGamepad, WebVibration, WebVR, WebMIDI,
          WebUSB, WebDRM, and WebXR. What&#8217;s all this <em>stuff</em> needed
          for? Yea, it makes sense for a Universal Application Development
          ToolKit, but it&#8217;s absolutely absurd to implement in a document
          reader:

            [On gemini there&#8217;s] absolutely no question of accidentally

            mine cryptocurrency for somebody else, because what kind of insane
            person would design document reading software where that&#8217;s a
            thing that could possibly happen under any circumstances?
          </p>

        <p>
          The Web platform is so insanely overscoped, that it&#8217;s difficult
          to even begin to understand:
        </p>

        <blockquote

          <p>
            The total word count of the W3C specification catalogue is 114
            million words at the time of writing. If you added the combined word
            counts of the C11, C++17, UEFI, USB 3.2, and POSIX specifications,
            all 8,754 published RFCs, and the combined word counts of everything
            on Wikipedia&#8217;s list of longest novels, you would be 12 million
            words short of the W3C specifications.

          It&#8217;s easy to see why it played out like this. Nowadays, every
          computer has a Web browser, which means a web app has perfect
          cross-platform compatibility at virtually no cost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Worse, the Web browser is becoming
          <a href="/v/19//blog.cjeller.site/browser-as-os"
            >a standalone OS of its own</a
          >. Google&#8217;s literally made their browser their OS&#8212;and it
          worked! To end users, the browser <em>is</em> the OS. It&#8217;s the
          first thing they open when starting their computer. What little
          &#8220;desktop&#8221; applications they install are often built with
          Electron, which is just running a browser engine without the browser
          <abbr title="Chrome is an alternative term for UI">chrome</abbr>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet again, it&#8217;s not remarkable that it played out like this:
        </p>

        <blockquote
          cite="//developers.slashdot.org/story/18/12/09/0941247/electron-and-the-decline-of-native-apps">
          <p>
            To paraphrase Churchill, Electron is the worst architecture for
            desktop applications, except for all the other ones that have been
            tried.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          My problem with the Web is that it&#8217;s trying to be two very
          different things&#8212;and failing at both:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              An <abbr title="Software Development Toolkit">SDK</abbr>, a
              platform for developing and shipping applications. Javascript is
              an absolutely <a href="/v/19//jsfuck.com">horrible</a>
              <a
                href="/v/19//old.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/lwc3gj/why_a_lot_of_software_engineers_say_javascript_is/"
                >language</a
              >. For many advanced applications, the JS bundle is so
              big&#8212;looking at you, Google Earth, that the poor Chromebooks
              at school straight up crash; the only way to bring them back to
              life is a hard reboot. Furthermore,
              <a href="/v/19//kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html"
                >not everyone can run Javascript</a
              >. So far for compatibility.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A good document reader&#8212;don&#8217;t tell me you think
              <a href="/v/19/blog/love-hate">this nightmare fuel</a> is decent.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Web tries to be everything. It&#8217;s a shopping centre, a
          workplace, a cafe, a chatroom, a game engine. I just want it to be a
          good document reader.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building a single all-encompassing standard&#8212;an everything
          protocol&#8212;was a mistake.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have standalone protocols for those things, you know. We have FTP
          and network shares for file sharing, IRC and XMPP for chatting, SMTP
          and DMARC for email, and RSS for syndicating creative work to
          audiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if we don&#8217;t have protocols for the things the Web is
          trying&#8212;and failing&#8212;to do, maybe, just maybe, we should
          build them.
        </p>
