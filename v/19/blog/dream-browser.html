        <h1>The Next Stage of the Web Browser</h1>

        <p>
          In his post
          <a href="/v/19//bandukwala.me/on-compositional-window-management/"
            ><cite>On compositional window management</cite></a
          >
          Alexander Bandukwala explores ways in which window managers could be
          improved. I can&#8217;t help but draw parallels to modern web
          browsers. Applications reimplement the window managers due to the
          limited feature set. Websites reimplement the web browser in the same
          way.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/v/19/blog/web-sdk">I complained</a> in the past, that I want the
          browser to be <em>just a document reader</em>. But let&#8217;s face
          it; it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s really just an SDK. But even for an
          SDK, it&#8217;s pretty bad.
        </p>

        <p>
          Websites keep reimplementing the browser using JS, because the browser
          <em>sucks</em>. Despite all their fancy advertising and redesigns,
          browser haven&#8217;t really evolved for the last decade. Yea,
          they&#8217;ve implemented a bunch more ridiculous Javascript APIs, but
          what real added value do they provide to the end-user?
        </p>

        <p>Here&#8217;s some things I&#8217;d want in my browser:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              You know all those cookie popups everywhere? What if they were
              just part of the browser? Currently, every website is allowed to
              save cookies by default. There&#8217;s nothing preventing a
              website from saving cookies anyway when you tap the tiny
              &#8220;no&#8221; button. What if we reverse that? Whenever a
              website tries to save cookies, the browser displays a standard
              popup with a clear &#8220;no&#8221; button that actually
              <em>denies the cookies</em>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              You know how websites have those complicated menus? Yea, what if
              my browser just scraped their <code>sitemap.xml</code> and
              compiled a convient index of the site for me?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              And while we&#8217;re at it, why not render a table of contents
              for every page? You know, those things Wikipedia and numerous
              other sites are now inserting into their HTML, because our
              document readers&#8212;oh sorry, I meant universal
              SDKs&#8212;still don&#8217;t have this feature?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              You know how links you&#8217;ve already visited turn purple
              (unless the website overrides it). What if we would indicate the
              target location of the link in a similar way? Links to other pages
              on the same site would stay as-is, but outgoing links would get
              some kind of extra indication. Also, it would be nice to know the
              page size of the target page upfront, especially on metered
              connections.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Also
              <a href="/v/19/blog/hotfox"
                >bringing back RSS discovery and subscriptions</a
              >
              <em>properly</em> would be pretty nice!
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Having publishing built into the browser would truly democratize
              the Web. Instead of the convoluted form-based UIs we could have a
              simple HTML editor builtin that could publish using
              <a href="/v/19//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT"
                >HTTP PUT</a
              >
              if the target server supports it.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Imagine if supporting writers and other creative people was
              built-in to the Web? A browser-native button to send the author of
              the page/media element a few bucks would allow creators to
              passively earn money by creating cool stuff. Maybe we could put
              <a href="/v/19//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/402"
                >HTTP 402</a
              >
              <i>Payment Required</i> to good use?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              And finally, how about actually useful building blocks for
              applications, instead of this JS+form madness we have now? The
              idea of building up the interface using a markup language such as
              HTML or XML is very good, but what if we could also utilize
              OS-native components in our designs?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Could somebody at Google or Mozilla maybe pretty please make (some of)
          this reality? /hj
