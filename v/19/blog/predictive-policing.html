        <h1>Predictive policing</h1>

        <p>
          Last week we were reading an article about predictive policing at
          school. These are my two cents.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In an era of tight budgets, police departments accross the country
            are being asked to do more with less. To address this problem,
            law-enforcement agencies are increasingly turning to data and
            analytics to improve their ability to fight crime without
            substantial increase in operating cost. Known as predictive
            policing, these technologies and techniques empower police officers
            to take a more proactive approach to both preventing crime and
            solving open cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            [T]he trend toward evidence-based [predictive] policing should
            ultimately enhance the relationship between communities and police
            officers.
            <strong
              >That&#8217;s because data-driven decision making is a step away
              from decisions based on biases that can result in unfair
              discrimination.</strong
            >
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Allow me to disagree. In computer science there&#8217;s a principle of
          <a href="/v/19//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIGO"
            >&#8216;garbage in, garbage out&#8217;</a
          >:
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIGO">
          <p>
            GIGO is the concept that flawed, biased or poor quality
            (&#8220;garbage&#8221;) information or input produces a similar
            result or output.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Your predictive policing algorithm may be objective, but the data
          it&#8217;s being trained on almost certainly isn&#8217;t. So
          you&#8217;ve actually made it worse: decisions made by such an
          algorithm are as biased as decisions made by humans, but with the
          illusion of objectivity. You haven&#8217;t eliminated bias;
          you&#8217;ve now institutionalised it.
        </p>

            <p>
              The use of data, like the use of any tool, leaves openings for
              misuse. There&#8217;s a big difference, for example, between
              predicting where crime is most likely to occur and
              <strong>
                developing a list of potential future offenders without probable
                cause,
              </strong>
              a practice that certainly raises serious ethical and legal
              concerns.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Just let me get this straight. You&#8217;re talking about creating a
            list of suspects for <em>crimes not yet committed</em>. What
            happened to the principle of &#8216;innocent until proven
            guilty&#8217;?
          </p>

          <p>
            While the article mentions <em>the possibility</em> of misuse of
            data for less ethical causes like this, it unfortunately
            doesn&#8217;t explain how it&#8217;s gonna <em>prevent</em> data
            being used for these purposes ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
