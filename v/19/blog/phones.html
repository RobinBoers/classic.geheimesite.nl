        <h1>Phones, assumptions and expectations</h1>

        <p>
          I&#8217;m 16 years old. I strongly dislike my phone. You never thought
          you&#8217;d ever hear those two sentences from the same person, did
          you?
        </p>

        <p>
          I started feeling like this a few years back. My parents decided I
          couldn&#8217;t charge my phone at night, and consequently my phone
          died a lot during the day. After a while, I stopped missing it. Even
          if I have it with me, I don&#8217;t use it anymore.
          <a href="//blog.geheimesite.nl/2022/03/een-maand-zonder-telefoon.html"
            >Last year, I challenged myself to put away my phone for a month</a
          >, and my primary conclusion was that most inconvience caused by not
          having a phone, is imposed by the expectations and assumptions of
          other people.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hate the fact that I&#8217;m expected to always be available for
          everyone. All it takes is one tap: <i>ping</i>. It&#8217;s annoying.
          Every time I&#8217;m trying to actually get something done, my phone
          just keeps going <i>beep boop ping pong</i>. It&#8217;s like someone
          is tapping my shoulder every few minutes. &#8220;Can I have your
          attention please?&#8221; My concentration is already severly
          fractured. I don&#8217;t want to know that you&#8217;ve tagged me, I
          don&#8217;t feel like sending selfies back and forth and I don&#8217;t
          care that some artist released a new album.
          <em>I just want to get my shit done</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Phones are supposed to be tools. Tools should never, ever,
          <em>ever</em>, have control over us. We&#8217;re supposed to be the
          master of our tools, not the other way around.
        </p>

        <p>
          That&#8217;s easily solved tho. My phone is always on silent. However,
          people still <em>expect</em> me read and reply instantly. That&#8217;s
          what bothers me: the fucking social pressure to participate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, everyone assumes you to have and always carry a phone
          with you. Oh yes,
          <em>let&#8217;s do a Kahoot</em>! Or some other activity requiring a
          phone. Or <em>just scan this QR code and you&#8217;ll be done</em>. Or
          how about we put the schedule on a mobile app? You&#8217;ll need a
          smartphone to get a DigiD too, which is needed to access your medical
          records, apply for vaccines, and pay your taxes. Sooner or later
          you&#8217;ll need to setup mobile banking as well, because the device
          we use for signing into the online banking portal doesn&#8217;t have
          replaceable batteries and we won&#8217;t give you a replacement when
          it eventually dies.
        </p>

        <p>
          It&#8217;s the small things, the assumptions and expectations.<br />
          And it&#8217;s so annoying.
