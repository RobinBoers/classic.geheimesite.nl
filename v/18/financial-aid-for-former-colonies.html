        <p>
          Recently I had a conversation with a few of my teammates at handball
          practice. We saw a news item about colonialism and were discussing
          whether countries should aid their ex-colonies. This debate mainly
          revolved around the how and why. It is a very interesting and nuanced
          topic that is highly relevant in our current society. Our conclusion?
          Countries should definitely support their former colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, providing aid is the morally right thing to do. While we
          arguably are not directly responsible for the colonisation of these
          countries &#8212; we had not yet been born back then &#8212; we do
          still benefit from past colonialism. For example, the colonial system
          helped kick off the industrial revolution (Acemoglu et al., 2005).
          Just as we still benefit from the colonial system, our ex-colonies too
          still suffer the effects of years of suppression and exploitation. How
          can we wash our hands in innocence if we still profit from the riches
          attained from past colonialism in our daily lives? The least we can do
          is donate a small portion of our wealth &#8212; which we partially
          deprived from exploitation of our ex-colonies in the first place
          &#8212; to our former colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, providing aid to these countries will allow them to
          flourish in the modern global economy. Financial aid allows countries
          to escape the &#8220;poverty trap&#8221; and develop their own,
          self-sustaining economies (Stiglitz, 2002). Consequently, we not only
          get to right our wrongs, but by providing support to our ex-colonies
          we also improve the global economy and welfare by reducing worldwide
          poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in some cases money is not the kind of support these
          countries need. We should also consider alternative ways to support
          our ex-colonies. For example, we could establish quality education and
          provide knowledge, resources and workers. According to the Mochy
          Trivium Foundation (2021) quality education is an &#8220;essential
          investment since it reduces poverty, boosts economic growth, increases
          the GDP of a country, creates employment opportunities, and improves
          overall health.&#8221; Therefore, providing alternative aid, such as
          good education, will help countries grow economically stronger and
          more independent, which means that long-term, they will not need
          financial support or other kinds of aid anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we should unquestionably support our former colonies, some
          people disagree. Admittedly, these countries can be pretty corrupt.
          According to the Corruption Perceptions Index (Transparency
          International, 2022) &#8212; a ranking of countries by their perceived
          corruption &#8212; former colonies are among some of the most corrupt
          countries in the world. Therefore, we should, as noted earlier,
          consider alternatives to financial support. That way, we can make sure
          that our aid actually ends up with the people of our ex-colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, we should also consider that by providing financial aid, our
          government obtains a position of power in our ex-colonies, which could
          easily be abused. According to Caldwell (2017), former colonies are
          very susceptible to neo-colonialism &#8212; &#8220;the involvement of
          more powerful states in the domestic affairs of less powerful
          ones&#8221; (Campbell et al., 2010). How can we claim to stay neutral
          when we have conflicting incentives in these countries? How will we
          make sure that our government will not use this position to exercise
          control over its ex-colonies? For example, according to The Guardian
          (2015), most of France’s development aid goes to its former colonies,
          where it’s mostly used to exercise economic power over the countries,
          as stated by Pigeaud and Sylla (2021) in their new book titled
          <em>Africa’s Last Colonial Currency: The CFA Franc Story</em>.
          Therefore, we should be very careful, and consider alternatives before
          providing financial support, since it can easily be abused by our
          government. In addition, we could also let the government be audited
          by independent third parties, to prevent this kind of abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, providing development aid to our ex-colonies is the
          ethically right thing to do, because we still actively benefit from
          past colonialism. The least we can do is provide aid. Furthermore, it
          allows these countries to set up their own economies, which will
          benefit the entire global economy. However, we should be cautious when
          it comes to financial support, because this can border on
          neo-colonialism. Therefore, we should also consider alternative ways
          to support our former colonies &#8212; for example providing people,
          knowledge, or materials &#8212; and let our government be audited by
          third parties.
