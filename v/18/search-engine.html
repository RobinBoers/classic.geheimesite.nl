        </p>
        <p>
          I have been thinking about what I want a search engine to do. It
          should do basically this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Search Wikipedia.
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#English-language_Wikipedia"
                >Apparently you can download the entirety of (English) Wikipedia
                in just 19GB</a
              >
              (compressed). This is excluding any page history/talk pages, and
              the dump doesn&#8217;t contain media. But still, 19GB is not that
              much. It expands to around 90GB, but I think that&#8217;s
              manageable if I run it on a local server.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Crawl and index Stack Exchange sites. Think Stack Overflow, Server
              Fault, Super User, Unix &amp; Linux, Mathematics, and Ask Ubuntu.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Optionally record my browsing history via a browser extension.
              This should be optional and contain a blacklist containing domains
              that shouldn&#8217;t be recorded &#8212; like search pages.
              Results from my own browser history should be less prominent.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Crawl websites on the small web. If you&#8217;re wondering what
              the heck I&#8217;m talking about, this explanation from
              <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/marginalia-search"
                >Marginalia Search</a
              >
              describes it pretty well:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Remember when you used to explore the Internet, when you used to
                discover cool little websites made by people and it wasn’t just
                a bunch of low effort content mill listicles and blog spam?<br />
                In recent years, something has been simmering: Some call it the
                “Small Internet”. I hesitate to call it a movement, that would
                imply a level of organization and intent that it does not
                possess. It’s a disjointed group of like-minded people that
                recognize that the Internet has lost a certain je ne sais quoi,
                it has turned from a wild and creative space, into more of
                shopping mall. Where ever you go, you’re prodded to subscribe to
                newsletters, to like and comment, to buy stuff.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              There&#8217;s a bunch of small indexes and search engines like
              this. I was planning to curate my own index, based on existing
              indexes. There should also be an option for people to submit
              sites.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Index some prominent Linux-oriented wikis, like the Arch Wiki and
              Gentoo Wiki. They seem to run the same wiki software as Wikipedia,
              so maybe they have a download option as well?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Searching man pages and RFCs seems cool?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Support for bangs, like DuckDuckGo. I&#8217;d want
              <code>!g</code> for Whoogle results and <code>!y</code> for
              YouTube.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This hypothetical search engine would be mainly for personal use, but
          I wouldn&#8217;t mind putting it on a public domain if I were to build
          it.
