        <p>
          A few days ago, I discovered the Gemini protocol. I heard about it a
          while back already, but I didn&#8217;t pay that much attention and
          failed to notice it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, naturally, I was REALLY excited about this cool new toy. I
          downloaded about four different clients/browsers to see which one I
          liked the best (it turned out to be
          <a href="/v/18//gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a>), and immediately
          thought about porting my website to it. Small problem however: my site
          is built using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I <em>love</em> Hugo. It&#8217;s fast. It&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s
          powerful. It&#8217;s fast. Did I mention that it&#8217;s fast?
          However, Hugo is also really centered around HTML files. And to make
          matters worse, my site is really complicated. It interacts with
          multiple things on <code>api.geheimesite.nl</code>, renders RSS feeds,
          downloads images, does fancy resource things.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, porting it over was gonna be <em>really hard</em>. So,
          instead of breaking my brain over porting my primary website, I took a
          look at my blog. Just like my website, my blog is built using Hugo.
          Because I do really like Hugo a lot. So, after a quick bit of
          Googling, I found out that I could
          <a href="https://sylvaindurand.org/gemini-and-hugo/"
            >add an output to Hugo</a
          >. But what would be the fun of that, eh?
        </p>
        <p>
          And to be honest, I&#8217;ve been wanting to build another blog for a
          while now. Actually, I already bought a domain for it 4 months back.
          Initially, I built it like a text-based system. I wrote a little PHP
          script that handled the HTTP <code>PUT</code> verb, which meant I
          could do cool things like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">curl http://example.com/essay.txt --upload-file essay.txt -u robin:password
</code></pre>
        <p>
          All files would be served as <code>text/plain</code>, and hyperlinks
          would be added on separate lines, where you could easily copy and
          paste them. Sounds familiar, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          I also got very hyped when I found
          <a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com">Wesley&#8217;s notebook</a> a
          while back. It&#8217;s such a simple, sleek and beautiful website. And
          the cool thing is that he completely wrote the thing using
          POSIX-complaint shell scripts, with almost no dependencies. In
          addition to one of the prettiest designs I&#8217;ve seen in a while,
          it also has a bunch of cool features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deep linking</li>
          <li>Very cool 404 page</li>
          <li>Images are automatically compressed</li>
          <li>Builtin <code>git</code> history with links to diffs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So, of course, I decided to create a new blog. And not just that, I
          wanted to build my own static site generator, just like Wesley did.
          So, I spent my weekend cooking up this little project.
        </p>
        <p>
          How does one build a SSG, you might ask? Well, it&#8217;s actually
          fairly simple, because a lot of the building blocks are already out
          there. For my project, I chose the
          <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/"
            >Liquid templating language</a
          >. Luckily, there&#8217;s already an amazing Javascript library for
          using Liquid out there, called
          <a href="https://liquidjs.com">LiquidJS</a>. The same goes for
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml">YAML parsing</a> and
          Markdown (using
          <a href="https://github.com/audiodude/gemdown">gemdown</a> and
          <a href="https://marked.js.org">marked</a> respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, after glueing together a bunch of libraries that other
          people wrote, I ended up with something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// This code snippet is greatly simplied,
// but the general flow is like this.

let globalVariables = readGlobalConfigFile();

let contentFiles = 
  getAllFilesWithExtension(".txt").map(mergeFrontmatterWithGlobalVariables);

for (const output in directoriesIn("templates")) {
  let template = parseDefaultTemplateFor(output);
  let pages = [];

  for(file in files.filter((f) => !isIndex(f))) {
    let destPath = generateDestinationPath(file, path.extname(template.path));
    let parsedMarkdown = parseMarkdown(template, getContent(file));
    let variables = { url: destPath, content_rendered: parsedMarkdown, ...variables };

    pages.append(variables);

    let finalContent = renderTemplate(template, variables);
    writeToFile(finalContent, output, destPath);
  }
  
  for(file in files.filter((f) => !isIndex(f))) {
    let destPath = generateDestinationPath(file, path.extname(template.path));
    let parsedMarkdown = parseMarkdown(template, getContent(file));
    let variables = { url: destPath, content_rendered: parsedMarkdown, pages: pages, ...variables };

    let finalContent = renderTemplate(template, variables);
    writeToFile(finalContent, output, destPath);
  }

  copyOverStaticFiles(output);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Yup. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
        <p>
          I settled on calling it <code>chop</code>, because I hoped it would be
          semi-fast (in dutch &#8220;chop chop&#8221; is a way to tell someone
          to speed things up).
        </p>
        <p>The initial version has these features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A global config file</li>
          <li>Front Matter</li>
          <li>Liquid templates</li>
          <li>Static files</li>
          <li>Multiple outputs (HTML, gemtext, RSS etc.)</li>
          <li>Smartypants punctuation</li>
          <li>Automatic image compression</li>
          <li>
            Render content as liquid templates (which allows you to use
            variables and partials in content)
          </li>
          <li>Prefixing relative URLs (in content).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But I&#8217;m planning to add quite a bit more:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
          <li>Automatic hashes in filenames for CSS</li>
          <li>Integration with <code>git</code> (for file history)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I&#8217;m not building this to be extendible or modular. Instead, this
          should stay a relatively simple script that just does what
          <em>I</em> want it to do. If <em>you</em> want to build something
          else, go for it!
        </p>
        <p>
          So yea. Writing <code>chop</code> was quite fun, and I&#8217;m
          definitely happy with the end result!
